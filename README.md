# Password-Generator 

## Description
The  main objective of this challenge was to genetate a random password based on the users criteria, through a series of prompts. The user had the option to choose between special, numerical, uppercase and lowercase charechters.

I have been able develop many skills during this challenge, such as using functions, for loops, if statements and breaking down the logic and psedocoding required to solve the problem easily. Undestanding of the scope of variables as well was well established during this project.
